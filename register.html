                        an official acceptance email from the conference organizing committee. The certificate of

                        author.

                    <p>
                        Interested attendees and non-presenting co-authors may register at any time by paying the
                        applicable registration fee through the designated account and completing the online
                        registration form. They must also upload the required documents, such as the payment receipt,
