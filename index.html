                  <p>Jaipur, the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Rajasthan, is located in Northern India. It was founded on November 18, 1727, by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the ruler of Amer, after whom the city is named. As per the 2011 Census, Jaipur had a population of approximately 3.1 million, making it one of the ten most populous cities in India at the time. Often referred to as the "Pink City" due to the dominant terracotta pink color of its buildings—especially in the old walled city—Jaipur lies about 268 km (167 miles) from New Delhi, the national capital. It forms a key part of India’s Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with Delhi and Agra, and is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the country.</p>
                  <p>Jaipur is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Jantar Mantar, an astronomical observatory, and the Amer Fort, a majestic fort located on the city’s outskirts. In the 2008 Condé Nast Traveller Readers’ Choice Awards, Jaipur was ranked the 7th best place to visit in Asia. Key attractions include the iconic Hawa Mahal, Jal Mahal, City Palace, Nahargarh Fort, Jaigarh Fort, Birla Mandir, Galtaji Temple, Govind Dev Ji Temple, Garh Ganesh Temple, Moti Dungri Ganesh Temple, Royal Gaitor Cenotaphs, Sanghiji Jain Temple, and the Jaipur Zoo. Beautiful gardens like Sisodia Rani Bagh and Kanak Vrindavan, along with the grand Raj Mandir Cinema, enhance the city’s charm.</p>
                  <p>Planned meticulously by Bengali architect Vidyadhar Bhattacharya under the principles of Vastushastra (traditional Hindu architecture), Jaipur features a grid-based city layout divided into six sectors with 34-meter-wide roads, a rarity among pre-modern Indian cities. Besides its architectural splendor, Jaipur is also a vibrant cultural hub. It is renowned for blue pottery, an intricate and colorful craft unique to the city, as well as its lively puppet shows, folk dances like Ghoomar and Kalbeliya, and traditional Rajasthani music. The city’s culinary heritage is equally rich, offering delicacies like Dal Baati Churma, Laal Maas, Gatte ki Sabzi, and sweets such as Ghewar and Mawa Kachori. Altogether, Jaipur stands as a perfect blend of history, culture, craftsmanship, and cuisine, making it a must-visit destination in India.</p>
