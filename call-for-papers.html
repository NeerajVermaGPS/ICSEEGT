                <ol>
                    <li>All manuscripts with similarity scores below 20% will undergo double-blind review by the
                        ICSEEGT 2025 Technical Program Committee.</li>
                    <li>Based on reviewer feedback, authors will receive one of the following decisions:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Revision Required:</strong> Revise the manuscript and resubmit (refer to
                                AIJR Journal submission tutorial).</li>
                            <li><strong>Decline:</strong> Understand the feedback, improve the manuscript, and
                                resubmit as a new submission.</li>
                            <li><strong>Accepted:</strong> Your manuscript will be copyedited and forwarded for
                                final publication.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>For the papers accepted with minor corrections, authors will be required to incorporate all the comments and corrections suggested by the reviewer and resubmit on Morressier again for final acceptance. </li>
                    <li>Papers presented at the conference will be submitted to the respective publisher based on the authors’ preference or the recommendation of the conference committee, only after the conference concludes. The review process, publication timeline, and indexing status (such as reflection in Scopus/Web of Science) are entirely subject to the policies and timelines of the specific journal or publisher. The conference committee shall not be held responsible for delays, revisions, or rejection at the journal or publisher level.</li>
                    <li>The final decision regarding the publication of an accepted manuscript in a partner journal or indexed proceedings rests solely with the editorial board of the respective journal. The conference committee does not influence or guarantee the outcome of this publication process. Please note that no refunds will be issued in cases where a manuscript is rejected by the journal, even if it was accepted for conference presentation.</li>
                    <li>Since all the communication during the review process is done via email, it is requested that the presenting author check their email (registered with ICSEEGT 2025) regularly.</li>
