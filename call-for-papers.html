                        double-blind review by ICSEEGT 2025 Technical Program Committee members, reviewers, and experts
                        in the respective field.</li>
                    <li>Based on reviewer feedback, authors will receive one of the following decisions:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Revision Required:</strong> Revise the manuscript and resubmit (refer to
                                AIJR Journal submission tutorial).</li>

                        comments and corrections suggested by the reviewer and resubmit on Morressier again for final
                        acceptance. </li>
                    <li>Papers presented at the conference will be submitted to the respective publisher based on the
                        authors’ preference or the recommendation of the conference committee, only after the conference
                        concludes. The review process, publication timeline, and indexing status (such as reflection in
                        Scopus/Web of Science) are entirely subject to the policies and timelines of the specific
                        journal or publisher. The conference committee shall not be held responsible for delays,
                        revisions, or rejection at the journal or publisher level.</li>
                    <li>The final decision regarding the publication of an accepted manuscript in a partner journal or
                        indexed proceedings rests solely with the editorial board of the respective journal. The
                        conference committee does not influence or guarantee the outcome of this publication process.
                        Please note that no refunds will be issued in cases where a manuscript is rejected by the
                        journal, even if it was accepted for conference presentation.</li>
                    <li>Since all the communication during the review process is done via email, it is requested that
